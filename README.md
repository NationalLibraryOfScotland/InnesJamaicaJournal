# InnesJamaicaJournal

This <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/iness/index.html">map viewer</a> allows you to journey through space, time and text in early 19th century Jamaica.

It combines the <em>Journal of Alexander Innes</em> (1823-24) with James Robertson's  mapping of Jamaica (1804), showing the locations that Innes visited highlighted in blue.

The <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/iness/index.html">map viewer</a> uses <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers 4.4.2</a> for the map interface, <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">JQuery</a> for some interactive features, and a <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaic in the map panel. For the date slider, we used the <a href="https://jqueryui.com/slider/">jQuery UI slider</a>, adapting a <a href="https://codepen.io/2rod/pen/JtIki">date range slider example</a>. 

The <a href="https://github.com/NationalLibraryOfScotland/InnesJamaicaJournal/blob/main/scripts/index.js">index.js</a> Javascript file is commented to explain the specific content and functions within it.

The content for this map has principally been gathered by Matthew Lee, a PhD placement student working on a collaborative project between the University of Aberdeen and the National Library of Scotland. The map viewer has been put together by Chris Fleet.
